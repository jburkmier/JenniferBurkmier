        I have dedicated today to separate the information I want to put on here into pages. 
        I would love to make these links into buttons but I have yet to learn that information as I continue to work through Angela Wu’s Udemy course. 
        I am still working through the kinks with formatting the picture and even the readability of the text. 
        Organizing the pages also helped me to focus on changing classes, id’s and helped me use the cascading style to streamline my coding. 
        A lot of background work went into today even though it does not show on the webpage.

            Borders! Fonts! Image Manipulation! 
            This is starting to slowly look like a real website as I continue to test out colors and work towards compartmentalizing my website in terms of the content it has. 
            I’m struggling with how different this looks on VSCode versus when I launch it on github but it looks much better on my phone so that is an interesting learning curve. 
            I see on this version that the image is much too large while my text is much too small. 
            I don’t love the colors for a professional website but it does strike joy as it reminds me of cotton candy and it is still fun playing with colors. I am eager to learn more about creating different pages and make this more interactive and dimensional.

            Color! I started learning about design elements through CSS and finally learned about adding color. 
            I found inspiration in this shampoo bottle so I made my website with a color template using this.

    I published my first website on Github under the instruction of Angela Wu.
    I started her Udemy course about website development during a summer while waiting for classes to start. 
    My first website only had html elements because I that was all I knew how to do but I was still very proud of these humble beginnings that included two links to pages and a picture.
